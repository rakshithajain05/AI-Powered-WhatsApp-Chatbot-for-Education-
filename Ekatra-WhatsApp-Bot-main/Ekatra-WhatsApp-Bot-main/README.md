## Understand how to configure WATI.
* Before we configure WATI, Did you know?
 As per WhatsApp Guidelines, the chat session expires after **24 hours** of your customer's last message sent time. 
After the 24 hours expiry, you can only send 'Template Messages'
* So, how do we approach this challenge?ü§î 
No need to worry, We've got this covered.üòä

* Refer [Schedule Template Message](https://github.com/ekatraone/schedule-template-messages) repository and implement the cron job that sends schedule template message everyday at a specific time and the session is restarted as soon as the user replies to the template message 

* Now, Follow [WATI Documentation](./docs/WATI.md) step-by-step to understand how to setup Webhook for our project both locally and remotely.
